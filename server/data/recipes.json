        "direction": "Prepare your pizza dough ahead of time. Our guide to making the perfect Classic Pizza Dough covers everything you need to know.\nFor the sauce for this pizza, we recommend preparing our easy Classic Pizza Sauce. With a hint of garlic, salt and basil, it's the ideal pizza sauce that will help to bring out the flavors in the other ingredients used here.\nFire up your Ooni pizza oven. Aim for 932˚F (500˚C) on the stone baking board inside. You can check the temperature inside your oven quickly and easily using the Ooni Infrared Thermometer.\nUsing a small amount of flour, dust your Ooni pizza peel. Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12″/16″ and lay it out on your pizza peel. Top with the mozzarella.\nSlide the pizza off the peel and into your Ooni pizza oven, making sure to rotate the pizza regularly.\nOnce cooked, remove the pizza from the oven and top with whole, fresh basil leaves. Serve immediately.",
